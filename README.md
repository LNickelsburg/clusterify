# **CLUSTERIFY**
**A tool for users to compare their Spotify listening histories**

This is a 3-step process:
1. Individual users retrieve their Spotify listening history (see "takeify")
2. User histories are consolidated, and track features are accessed from the
Spotify API
3. Features undergo PCA dimensionality reduction, then are visualized based on
K-means clustering and based on user tag
